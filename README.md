End-to-End Retail Sales ETL & Analytics Project (Python, SQL, SQLAlchemy)

This project showcases an end-to-end ETL pipeline built using a real retail sales dataset. I extracted the data from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, cleaned and standardized it in 
Python by handling missing values, fixing inconsistent text fields, converting data types, and creating key business metrics such as sale price, discount amount, and profit.
After preparing the data, I loaded it into a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy and used SQL to analyze sales, revenue, profit, and time-based trends. 
The analysis includes identifying top-performing products, regional sales leaders, month-over-month growth between years, and the most profitable sub-categories by state. 
Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to move from raw data to meaningful business insights using Python and SQL in a realistic ETL workflow.
